# Plank's Equation

Basically this repository will help to how you can calculate a **Plank's Equation**.

Is used to calculate the **energy** of a photon based on the frequency of eletromagnetics radiation.

Here's what each term represents:

- E: Energy of the photon (in joules **J**)

- h: Plank's constant, which is **6,63x10^-13**(joules per second)

- f: Frequency of the eletromagnetic radiation (in hertz, **Hz**)

# What the equation calculates:

This equation describes the relationship between the energy of a photon (a particle of light) and its frequency. In other words, it helps you calculate the **energy** of a photon when you know the frequency of the associated electromagnetic wave.

# For example:

If you have a light wave with a frequency *F = 5 * 10^14 Hz*, you can calculate the energy of the corresponding photon using the formula:

###### E = (6.63 * 10^-34) * (5 * 10^14)

The resulting energy would be in joules.







# Wave Propagation Equation

The equation **Wave Propagation Equation** C = λ * f is used to describe the relationship between the speed of light, wavelength, and frequency of an electromagnetic wave.

Here's what each term represents:

- C: The speed of light in a vacuum (approximately **3 * 10^8 m/s, or 300,000 kilometers per second**).

- λ (lambda): The **wavelength** of the wave (in meters, m). The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave.

- f: The **frequency** of the wave (in hertz, Hz). The frequency is how many cycles or oscillations the wave completes per second.

# What the equation calculates:

This equation expresses the relationship between the speed of light, the frequency of a wave, and its wavelength. It tells you that the speed of light is equal to the product of the wavelength and frequency of the wave.

If you know any two of the quantities (speed, wavelength, or frequency), you can calculate the third one.

## How to use the equation:

- To calculate wavelenght (λ), rearrange the equation as: λ=C/f
So, if you know the frequency *F* of a wave and the speed of light *C*, you can calculate the wavelength.

- To calculate frequency (f), rearrange the equation as: f=C/λ
So, if you know the wavelength *λ* and the speed of light *C*, you can calculate the frequency.

# For example:

If you have a light wave with a wavelength of 500 nm (nanometers), and you want to find its frequency, you can rearrange the equation to solve for *F*:

- First, convert the wavelength to meters: 500nm = 5 * 10^-7 m.
- Then, use the equation F = C/λ to find the frequency

F = 3 * 10^8 m/s / 5 * 10^-7m
